# Human body and hand kinematic structure analysis in a 3D environment


## Objectives:

- To develop a software tool to demonstrate the kinematic structure (links and different types of joints and degree-of-freedom) of a typical human body and a typical human hand in more detail.

- The analysis of the kinematic structure of the human body and of the human hand is based in the anatomical/medical terminology of the different joints and degrees-of-freedom. The full description is available here.


## Outputs:

- Two software tools (human full body and hand) were developed in Python using the development environment Vizard VR Software Toolkit.

- The software tools allow the users to select the joint and degree-of-freedom that they want to explore by changing the flexure level using a slider. The users can also change the view perspective of the 3D avatars. The links are represented by blue lines and the joints by the red dots. The Python source code can be downloaded here and a compiled version (Vizard in Windows environment) of the software tools here. Demonstration videos showing a typical interaction with both applications are presented next.
